TODO

VHIGH More functions to iterate over components more efficiently

HIGH Find components and objects of name

MED Multiple components of same type in an object

MED Tree of objects? eg the menu system could all be one object?

VHIGH remove the parameter from 'update event. The game will be able
to specify a list of messages that are sent every frame, but these
will not have arguments. The only useful argument is frame delta, and
that is globally available.

VHIGH WIP Pong prototype

      need to parameterise screen height, width etc playfield and camera

      need a logical play area for pong (score and so on separate)

            the window needs to know what the camera offset is 

LOW      bonus modes, lots of balls.
      
HIGH (performance related) Global object list
      Some way to have collision system run through all physics 
      components and process all collision
      Needs to be done outside of current update loop

MED Object factory
      Able to create instances of objects from a text or DSL spec
      Instances share data if possible

MED Drawing must be deferred so you can sort, do layers and so on

	Draw instructions not operations

	Instruction structure? should be just the exact same draw call but deferred

	Could be macro

HIGH Sound - using my stuff or SDL_Mixer
