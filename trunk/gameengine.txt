Interactive Game Engine

TODO

VHIGH game must tell engine which messages to do each frame, messages are game specific

VHIGH iterate over components more efficiently

VHIGH lose the globals from engine, replace with engine struct

MED Multiple components of same type in an object

VHIGH WIP Pong prototype

      need to parameterise screen height, width etc playfield and camera

      need a logical play area for pong (score and so on separate)

      the window needs to know what the camera offset is 

LOW      bonus modes, lots of balls.
      
MED Object factory
      Able to create instances of objects from a text or DSL spec
      Instances share data if possible
      Be able to reset data to initial values

MED Drawing must be deferred so you can sort, do layers and so on

	Draw instructions not operations
	Instruction structure? should be just the exact same draw call but deferred
	Could be macro

HIGH Sound - using my stuff or SDL_Mixer
     My stuff sucks
     SDL mixer is unstable
     Best option is to use SDL_Mixer but allow it to be unused during dev
