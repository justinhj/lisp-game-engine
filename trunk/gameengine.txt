Things to do 

Drawing must be deferred so you can sort after the fact

	Draw instructions not operations

	Instruction structure? should be just the exact same draw call but deferred

	Could be macro

Decent solution to state machine

More interactive programming capabilities

Move screen and sdl stuff to class

Animation



Keyboard and joystick needs to get captured and relayed to objects

	 I like the java listener model

	 EG make a keyboard event listener

	 when object constructed add to list of listeners for that event

	 keyboard events sent to all listeners
