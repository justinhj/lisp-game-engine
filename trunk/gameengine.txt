Things to do

VHIGH Design for more than one level 



VHIGH Pong prototype

      need to parameterise screen height, width etc

      need a logical play area for pong (score and so on seperate)

      the window needs to know what the camera offset is 

X      player 1 and 2

      ai
X	needs to get ball trajectory 

      scoring

      game ending 

      bonus mode, lots of balls.
      

HIGH (performance related) Global objects
      Some way to have collision system run through all physics 
      components and process all collision
      Needs to be done outside of current update loop

HIGH Better way to send messages to everything (or rather not 
      send them to everything)

HIGH Object factory
      Able to create instances of objects from a text or DSL spec
      Instances share data if possible

X HIGH Decent solution to state machine

  State machine can be a component
  It responds to the update message
  Only difference being, what it does depends on state
  It can either have explicit state changes within states
  or you the usual data driven stuff

HIGH More interactive programming capabilities

X     split engine into init, run and quit
       run engine as a process in various capable cl's
       need to do deferred adding and deleting of objects midframe though

MED Drawing must be deferred so you can sort, do layers and so on

	Draw instructions not operations

	Instruction structure? should be just the exact same draw call but deferred

	Could be macro

X HIGH component and message passing design

Game component or high level object 

	Has the active object list
	Objects can be active for update and draw

Level

	Need a level class that can

	     Store objects
	     Insert them to the active object list
	     Reset them to beginning values
	     Remove its objects from the active list

Animation

	Need to be able to change the animation an object is doing
	(Can do this by changing the sprite def in the animation
	component)

Message system

	Objects need to be able to send messages to

		specific objects by name
X		objects that are listening for this type

Physics

	Detect collisions (need world representation)
	message to colliding objects

Keyboard and joystick needs to get captured and relayed to objects

	 Or just let player component do it?
	 That's ok as long as you can abstract the 
	 keys so it's configurable

GAME			LEVEL

enter level		has list of game objects
leave level		


Misc
X	Make sure engine-init, run and quit cannot be used inappropriately

game

  list of levels

  list of objects in world

  function goto level
  	   finds a level by name or perhaps index
	   calls level-end on current level
	   calls level-begin on new level


level - is a class providing the following

	level-begin
		in which you create objects and add them to the world
		you could also take objects in the current list and do stuff with them

	level-update t
		which is called with frame delta time 't'
		in which you can do whatever you want 
		
		
	level-end
		in which you remove objects from the world that you are sure the next level
		will not want
